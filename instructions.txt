1. In order to intereact with CrowdCoin you must first have MetaMask Chrome extension installed on the browser. You can add it to your browser here https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn
There is also an introduction video on this page, so you can use it to get started with MetaMask.
2. Then you will need to get some fake ETH on Rinkeby test network. You can get some from this Rinkeby faucet https://faucet.rinkeby.io/
In order to get ETH from the faucet you must make a new post on either Twitter, Facebook or Google Plus (in this case I used Twitter) containing only your wallet address. Example: https://serving.photos.photobox.com/1069499460671225de6bd055fca9b475d602e032ae590a85caad9e25ce278efd6394ef6c.jpg
Then copy your posts link (circled blue in the picture) and paste it into the faucet's search bar (https://faucet.rinkeby.io/)
3. Next to the search bar there is a button that says 'Give me Ether'. Click it and from the dropdown you can choose how much ETH you want. Once you select a value, Ether should come to your faucet in about 15-30 seconds.
4. That's it! You're all set up to start interacting with the Dapp. Make sure that everytime you interact with the Dapp, you have selected Rinkeby test net (https://serving.photos.photobox.com/15989932af73188d9a6e212e889262b8883117b39de29cd6e8a4c26e35bdaefdf3a6a4df.jpg
5. Every time when you call a transaction, MetaMask will pop up and you can edit gas fee, submit or reject the transaction. Have fun!
